In order to use the program, compile all files in the "state" package and run PentagoMain.class as the entry point. After entering the human player's name and color, as well as the AI player's name, the game will start.
The human player can enter moves in the usual format: "(block #)/(cell #) (block # to rotate)(direction to rotate, L/R)".
